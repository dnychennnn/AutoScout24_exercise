# AUTOSCOUT24 Technical Exercise

## Task Description

Car adverts should have the following fields:
* **id** (_required_): **int** or **guid**, choose whatever is more convenient for you;
* **title** (_required_): **string**, e.g. _"Audi A4 Avant"_;
* **fuel** (_required_): gasoline or diesel, use some type which could be extended in the future by adding additional fuel types;
* **price** (_required_): **integer**;
* **new** (_required_): **boolean**, indicates if car is new or used;
* **mileage** (_only for used cars_): **integer**;
* **first registration** (_only for used cars_): **date** without time.

Service should:
* have functionality to return list of all car adverts;
  * optional sorting by any field specified by query parameter, default sorting - by **id**;
* have functionality to return data for single car advert by id;
* have functionality to add car advert;
* have functionality to modify car advert by id;
* have functionality to delete car advert by id;
* have validation (see required fields and fields only for used cars);
* accept and return data in JSON format, use standard JSON date format for the **first registration** field.

## Solution Description
This solution is backboned by Scala Play REST API example. Some key features regarding the solution is described as follows,

### Solved
1. Local storage is a mock DB class `CarRespository` with a `CarResourceHandler` for data I/O
    - shortage: 
        - data in RAM not in disk
        - didn't practice Amazon Dynamo DB or any other kinds.
    - improvements: 
        - data storage using ListBuffer, some other data structure like heap or tree like can be considered.
2. Data fields: mostly using primitive types
    - improvements: 
        - Need to clarify how to properly use DateTime in Scala. (Didn't try joda)
3. APIs are implemented following MVC structure, where `CarController` describes all of the features
    - validation: using play **Form** with verifying to check the used car dependencies.
 
    
### Future work

1. CORS
2. test
3. Amazon Dynamo DB


## Installation & Running

### Requirements
- java higher than 8
- sbt

You need to download and install sbt for this application to run.

Once you have sbt installed, the following at the command prompt will start up Play in development mode:

```bash
sbt run
```

Play will start up on the HTTP port at <http://localhost:9000/>.   You don't need to deploy or reload anything -- changing any source code while the server is running will automatically recompile and hot-reload the application on the next HTTP request.

## Usage

If you call the same URL from the command line, youâ€™ll see JSON. Using [httpie](https://httpie.org/), we can execute the command:


**LIST** : To list all cars (defaul sorted by id)
```bash
http --verbose http://localhost:9000/v1/cars
```
and get back:

```routes
GET /v1/cars HTTP/1.1
```

**LIST with query** : To list cars with optional sorting by field, e.g. price
```bash
http --verbose http://localhost:9000/v1/cars/?sort_by=price
```
and get back(example):

```routes
GET /v1/cars/?sort_by=price HTTP/1.1 
```

**GET single car advert**: To return a single car advert using GET request
```bash
http --verbose http://localhost:9000/v1/cars/id
```

**ADD car advert** : To add car advert with POST request
```bash
http --verbose POST http://localhost:9000/v1/cars title="abc" fuel=0 price=12341234 isnew=true
```

**DELETE car advert** : To delete car advert by **id** with DELETE request, e.g., delete "Audi e-tron"(uuid = 77144954-beff-410b-9dff-a39e259a2ac0)
```bash
http --verbose DELETE http://localhost:9000/v1/cars/"77144954-beff-410b-9dff-a39e259a2ac0"
```

**MODIFY**
Pass
